Instructions for PreProcessing:
You can bind the train and test to a full dataset for variable recoding and feature engineering, e.g.

full = bind_rows(train, test)

After you're done with initial preprocessing, split them apart once again for further processing. 
You can do this by looking at the no. of rows each dataset had in the beginning, e.g.

train = full[1:764,]
test = full[765:891,]

Please do it this way, so we can assure that each group has the identical train and test set for final performance comparison and that prediction on the test set works. 


Variable Notes

pclass: A proxy for socio-economic status (SES)
1st = Upper
2nd = Middle
3rd = Lower

age: Age is fractional if less than 1 (babies). If the age is estimated, is it in the form of xx.5

sibsp: The dataset defines family relations in this way...
Sibling = brother, sister, stepbrother, stepsister
Spouse = husband, wife (mistresses and fianc√©s were ignored)

parch: The dataset defines family relations in this way...
Parent = mother, father
Child = daughter, son, stepdaughter, stepson
Some children travelled only with a nanny, therefore parch=0 for them.
