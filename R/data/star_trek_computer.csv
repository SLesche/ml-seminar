Alexander is wearing a small practice robe similar to the one we've seen Worf use. He is fighting the SKULL FACED ALIEN  seen in previous episodes  with Worf's bat'telh sword. Alexander is awkward and uncomfortable with the sword... it's really too big for him. The Alien swings the axe again... Alexander barely moves out of the way. As he finds Alexander in the holodeck. His anger at Alexander mixes with some pride as he sees what the boy is doing. Worf continues to watch discreetly with conflicting emotions as his son struggles with the fearsome Alien. The Alien isn't fighting at full speed  the program has slowed to match Alexander's lesser skill  but the boy is still having a hard time holding his own against the creature. Alexander trades thrusts and parries... gets knocked down... gets up for more. Worf unconsciously moves his own hands and arms in response to the movements of the Alien. Alexander charges the Alien  yelling like a banshee... the Alien retreats before the assault... finally the creature gives the boy an obvious opening and Alexander plunges the sword into its stomach... As the Alien VANISHES in response to the kill. Alexander steps back  breathing heavily.
